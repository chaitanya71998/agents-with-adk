# agents-with-adk

This is a Python project for creating conversational agents using the Agent Development Kit (ADK).

## 🐍 What is Python ADK?

The Python ADK (Agent Development Kit) is a toolkit that enables developers to build, test, and deploy conversational agents (also known as chatbots or virtual assistants) using Python. With ADK, you can define agent behaviors, handle user inputs, integrate with third-party APIs, and manage conversation flows—all in a flexible, developer-friendly environment.

### Key Features

- **Easy to Use:** Write your agent logic in pure Python—no need to learn a new language or framework.
- **Modular Design:** Organize your agent's actions, messages, and context handling in reusable components.
- **Extensible:** Connect to external APIs, databases, and cloud services to make your agent more powerful.
- **Testing Tools:** Built-in utilities make it straightforward to test and debug your agent before deployment.
- **Cloud Integration:** Seamless integration with platforms like Google Cloud for scalability and deployment.
